## Hey there! I am using GitHub :smiley:

### About me :point_down:
Some time ago, I started coding and thought it was pretty cool.  I love overcoming the challenges that programming problems offer to me and I like continuous learning, as the impossible becomes possible when code is involved. So, I decided to dive in and started training in **Web Application Development**. :technologist:

My interests extend to nearly everything that involves science and art. I enjoy music production and watching films or series. While this page may currently seem a bit empty, Iâ€™ll be uploading some exciting projects soon. :wink:
